Creating a new project based on a remote Git or Subversion repository

If you have an existing remote Git or Subversion repository that you want to use as the basis for an RStudio project you should:

Execute the New Project command (from the Project menu)
Choose to create a new project from Version Control
Choose Git or Subversion as appropriate
Provide the repository URL (and other appropriate options) and then click Create Project
The remote repository will be cloned into the specified directory and RStudio's version control features will then be available for that directory.
